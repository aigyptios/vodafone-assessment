# Vodafone React Challenge

This is my submission (13/11/2019) for the Senior Frontend Developer Role.

Things I would like to do to make this better (if I had the time):
- **Refactor the CSS.** The CSS could be more modular. Currently things that are React Components have their own CSS file, but everything else is in `index.css`. I would like to split it up into other helper files. I can also abstract certain properties into more reusable classes (e.g., container, row, grid, classes for visual spaces).
- **Refactor folder structure.** Mostly I think I could separate assets into folders, and along with the CSS refactoring have a more readable structure, though as it is now I think it works for such a small application.
- **Add unit tests.** Currently there are this many real tests: 0
- **Accessibility.** More semantic HTML.
- **Pixel Perfection.** Currently it is not pixel perfect (in terms of spacing and colors, though I did try my best). I took more liberties because one requirement was to be responsive but no responsive mock-ups/PSD files were provided.
